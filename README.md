# vite-react-ts-linting

This application enables users to upload a CSV file, select relevant fields to determine recipients, and then utilizes Twilio to send messages to those specified users. It's an efficient solution for targeted, bulk messaging based on user-defined criteria in the CSV. Based on my very first real coding project I made using Python. Interface is based on Apple's message app.

## New Technology

- Maybe use next.js
- postgresSQL for db
  - probably not prisma for this project?

## TODO

- create message settings
  - scheduled
  - recurring
- add delivered thing
- mess with grey color (zinc, natural, etc)
- typing responsive (new row) -> make sure bottom moves up as message does
- custom fields in message

- actual logic for frontend actions
  - add new message

### Auth

- login - tryout prebuilt auth package

### backend part

- test out prisma + postgressql
- actual implementation of backend

### frontend updates

- when send message add to texts and then resend instructions

### NextJs??
